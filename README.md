# Light Hacks âš¡
Light Hacks puts creativity in the hands of anybody who wants control over their light displays without the need for programming expertise! Providing an intuitive code-block interface, users can customize their light's movement, patterns, colors, brightness and more!

## How It's Made:

**Tech Stack:** 

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
**Backend & Database**: Python Webserver and an Arduino IDE

We started by creating a frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that takes in light pattern sequences, and from there we sent it to our backend database built using Python. We then used our backend to grab the sequences from the database and pushed it to our arduino. We built Light Hacks physically with an Arduino Nano to connect the lights to the world. 

## How to Test It Out Yourself

Want to try it out yourself? Connect an arduino microcontroller via USB to your computer, then using an Arduino IDE, run the Arduino Flash file. Input your own API key when prompted.
